Here you'll find both the User and Developer documentation for GPMDP.  If you have any questions please head over to [Gitter](https://gitter.im/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-) and ask there before raising a GitHub issue.
The application is written in Javascript using the new ES6 standard, because of this we use [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile
all our ES6 code into ES5 compatabile code.

Please keep in mind that GPMDP uses quite a few upstream modules to make our job easier so you might want to check their docs out
as well.
